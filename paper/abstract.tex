% ABSTRACT

In today's world, smartphone users expect an always-on Internet connection. Entire products and software systems are built upon the assumption that users are always connected to the Internet. However, mobile devices with cellular data and WiFi capabilities often lose connectivity due to policies that favor WiFi, even when the signal is poor. This makes many always-connected applications less useful or completely useless. In this paper we present a set of new policies that mitigate connection issues caused by switching between simultaneously available WiFi and cellular networks. By clinging less strongly to WiFi, we can increase connection uptime without an appreciable tradeoff. By bringing mobile devices closer to the ideal state of constant connectivity, we greatly improve the mobile device user experience.
