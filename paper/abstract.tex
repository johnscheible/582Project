% ABSTRACT

In today's world, users and applications rely on omnipresent internet connectivity. Entire products and software systems are built upon the assumption that users are always connected to the internet. However, mobile devices with cellular data and WiFi capabilities often drop connectivity to navigate between available connections. This makes many ``always-connected" appliations less useful or completely useless. In this paper we present a set of policies that mitigate connection issues casued by simultaneous internet connection options. We believe that these policies can greatly increase the connectivity of mobile devices and more fully realize the always-connected environment many applications and users rely on every day.
