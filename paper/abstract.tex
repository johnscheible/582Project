% ABSTRACT

In today's world, users and applications rely on omnipresent Internet connectivity. Entire products and software systems are built upon the assumption that users are always connected to the Internet. However, mobile devices with cellular data and WiFi capabilities often drop connectivity in order to navigate between available connections. This makes many always-connected applications less useful or completely useless. In this paper we present a set of policies that mitigate connection issues caused by switching between simultaneously available WiFi and cellular networks. By clinging less strongly to WiFi, we can increase connection uptime without appreciably increasing the risk that users will exceed cellular data caps[TODO - support]. By bringing mobile devices closer to the ideal state of constant connectivity, we greatly benefit the mobile device user experience
