1) Test WiFi-only connection strength during walk to bus stop and back
2) Set preference to 3G. Make the same walk.
	- If we stay connected to 3G the whole time, we have full control
	- If not, we have to turn off WiFi when Android overrules us.
3) Implement policies
4) Run same tests with policies



KEVIN -
1) Get 582 stuff working! Collect data!
2) Make a poster!
3) Write paper!
4) Write 376 paper!
5) Stats final. Meh.
6) Get a new flight, apparently....


============================PAPER EVALUATION============================
Grading based on "Can we":

1) Identify an important problem
	- 3 kinds of statements
		- Cited data
		- Demonstrated data
		- Bullshit
2) Convince Prabal it's important
	- Apparently we already did this. Yay!
3) Demonstrate an understanding of the related work
	- Distinguish from other work
		- Maybe show better understanding of existing Android/iOS WiFi policies
	- Shit...
4) Clear hypothesis
	- Elements of hypothesis
		- Observations
		- Claim relating dependant and independant variables
5) Plan and execute a reasearch project
	- Identify key experiments/analysis
	- Demonstrate step-by-step argument formulation
		- Easy-to-follow set of well-supported claims.
	- No weak links in argument chain
6) Convey results concisely, crisply, clearly, and convincingly
	- In 1-2 sentences
	- Stated explicitly in the abstract, intro, and conclusion
	- Demonstrate some shred of =======insight======= - the "nugget"
		- Have an "a-ha!" moment
		- We might struggle with this...
	- Clearly
		- Some set of "a ha" figures/tables
		- Every caption MUST be self-sufficient and descriptive
			- Look at his stuff about captions
			- What is it that I'm looking at here?
			- What does the data show?
			- What does this imply? (i.e. why should the reader care?)
	- Convincingly
		- Error bounds / condience intervals
		- STATS bro, STATS
			- 95% confidence interval preferable
		- Multiple trials
		- CDFs where appropriate
		- Validation of hypothesis
		- Identify shortcomings
			- When does is fail?
