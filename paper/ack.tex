We would like to thank Prabal Dutta for his guidance and advice as our instructor for this class. Pat Pannuto, Eric Wustrow, and Brad Campbell were also a great help in leading class discussions over the course of the semester. The members of the University of Michigan EECS community who talked to us at our poster session were invaluable in giving us feedback to polish our work into this paper. Finally we thank the rest of the students in the class for their feedback during the semester and reviews.
