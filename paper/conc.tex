Conclusions and Future Work\ldots

Our policy implementations show that it is possible to increase connections uptime for mobile devices by clinging less strongly to WiFi networks. They allow devices to better support the always-connected environment that applications and users rely on every day in mobile computing.

We also acknowledge that our policies may adversly affect battery life. Therefore, a follow study of the effects of the policies on battery life is necessary.

It is important to note that the benefits of WiFi access testing and preemptive WiFi abondonment are demonstrable even with a suboptimal implementation. We strongly believe that the policies would show much better performance when implemented, ideally, as a part of Anrdoid's core operating system. The success of the policies as application-level implementations suggests that further investigation into integration into the Android operating system is worth pursuing.

Additionally, while we were unable to implement our policies on iOS devices, we observed that iOS suffered from all 3 of the issues addressed. Thus, we believe that the policies may also benefit iOS devices (as well as other mobile device operating systems such as Windows Phone 8).
